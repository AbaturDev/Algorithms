# Algorithms - University Project

## Project 1 - Efficient Packet Management Algorithm

Our task revolved around designing and implementing an algorithm for managing and sorting packets. Each packet was assigned a unique identifier and had to be sorted and arranged correctly. The objective was to construct an efficient solution capable of effectively handling random packet receptions.

Proposed solution in the project is implementation of merge sort algorithm and function for composing message. Implementation in C++.

## Project 2 - Sorting algorithms

The task involved implementing three sorting algorithms and evaluating their efficiency. The following algorithms were chosen for this project:
* Merge sort
* Quick sort
* Bucket sort

The objective was to compare the efficiency of these sorting algorithms based on their execution time and computational complexity. The data set for testing was provided in the file "projekt2_dane.csv". This file is a trimmed database of movies from the "IMDb Largest Review Dataset" on kaggle.com, containing only the ranking and title of the movies. The sorting was performed based on the movie rankings.

The sorting algorithms were implemented in C++.
