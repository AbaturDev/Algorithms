## Project 1 - Efficient Packet Management Algorithm

Our task revolved around designing and implementing an algorithm for managing and sorting packets. Each packet was assigned a unique identifier and had to be sorted and arranged correctly. The objective was to construct an efficient solution capable of effectively handling random packet receptions.

Proposed solution in the project is implementation of merge sort algorithm and function for composing message. Implementation in C++.
